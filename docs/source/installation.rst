   $ Your Scopus API key: (Here you enter your API key)

3.  Finally we can check the installation by doing the following:

    * Navigate to the installation directory from the command line.

      .. code-block:: console
		      
	 $ cd ~/Pyscholar/src
   
    * Execute a Python `REPL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL>`_
      with the :command:`python` or :command:`ipython` commands, for example:
